                    It is with great pride that I greet all members and supporters of the National Service Scheme (NSS) at Netaji Subhas University of Technology. NSS plays a vital role in shaping our students' character by fostering social responsibility and community service. NSS volunteers exemplify compassion, leadership, and selflessness through their dedication to various social initiatives. Their efforts inspire us and create a positive impact on society. I encourage every student to actively engage in NSS programs. Through service, you will not only make a difference but also develop valuable skills and lasting friendships. Thank you for your commitment to NSS. Your efforts help make our university a true beacon of change
